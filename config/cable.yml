# Async adapter only works within the same process, so for manually triggering cable updates from a console,
# and seeing results in the browser, you must do so from the web console (running inside the dev process),
# not a terminal started via bin/rails console! Add "console" to any action or any ERB template view
# to make the web console appear.

# PRODUCTION: Using async adapter for single-database deployment (Render free tier)
# =============================================================================
# The original solid_cable adapter requires a separate 'cable' database connection.
# For Render's free/basic tier with a single database, we use the async adapter.
#
# Limitation: async only works within a single process, so ActionCable broadcasts
# won't work across multiple dynos/instances. This is fine for demos and small apps.
#
# To restore solid_cable with multiple databases:
#   adapter: solid_cable
#   connects_to:
#     database:
#       writing: cable
#   polling_interval: 0.1.seconds
#   message_retention: 1.day
